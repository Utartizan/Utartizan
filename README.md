# Welcome to my profile! 👋

![Hello Gif](https://media1.tenor.com/m/BbZnw0Mc1mUAAAAd/crow-smart.gif)

My name is Ubayd Knight. I'm an **Accounting & Economics final-year student at the University of Huddersfield**, attempting to make something big from my passion in quantitative analysis.

Before moving onto anything, I take pride in being a massive innovator and always learning about what could change the future. I'm planning on honing in on my quantitative and programming skills by creating a profitable trading algorithm using probabilistic methods with a positive Sharpe ratio, exceeding Index returns.
 
Therefore, what you see here is solely the result of a combination of utmost interest and uncapped passion in everything related to code, trading, and data. 

Here's a glimpse into my journey heading into the ultra-competitive industry of Quantitative Finance:

## 💼 Projects

### 📊 [GARCH Stock Volatility Forecast Analysis Tool](https://github.com/Utartizan/Stock-Volatility-Forecasting-Analysis-Tool)
- A Streamlit Cloud hosted Website built with Python, retrieving 10-year stock data from yFinance, processed by Pandas and NumPy, with statistical modelling from Arch and Statsmodels libraries, visualised by Plotly.
- Returns historical volatility (21-day rolling, annualised) and GARCH-forecasted volatility.
- Displays a mini stock plot for the users selected stock ticker on the sidebar.
- Runs four separate tests (ARCH-LM, Sign Bias, Ljung-Box, Garch Stability) to see if the predictive GARCH model fits the stock’s volatility well.

### 📈 [Quantitative Momentum Strategy](https://github.com/Utartizan/Quantitative-Momentum-Strategy)
- Built a finance algorithm utilising Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy) to generate an optimised stock portfolio (S&P500) based on price momentum.
- Applied methodologies to enhance user experience by allowing users to define their portfolio through a customised number of stocks and shares.
- Utilised 'xlsxwriter' library to enable portfolio saving for users interested in graphical analysis.


### 📖 [US Market Index Analysis with Google Trends](https://github.com/Utartizan/US-Market-Index-Analysis-with-Google-Trends)
- Analysed the relationship between US market indicies (VIX, S&P500, DJI, NASDAQ) and Google Trends data over a 10-year
period.
- Utilised Yahoo Finance and Google Trends API to identify correlations between market performance and search trends.
- Analytical methods consist of logarithmic calculation, summary statistic analysis, and refined ARIMA models.

### 🖥️ [Stock Price Predictor](https://github.com/Utartizan/Random-Forest-Predictor--Stocks-)
- Developed an interactive R-based application for predicting stock prices of top S&P 100 companies using R packages such as shiny, quantmod, forecast, and ggplot2.
- Utilised Random Forest models to generate 30-day forecasts based on historical data.
- Features included adjustable training data percentages, dynamic stock selection, and visualisations of historical and predicted prices.

### 🏠 [Home Credit Risk Assessor](https://github.com/Utartizan/Credit-Risk-Assessment)
-  Fetches data from a large trained dataset, including historical loan data and utilises logistic regression to predict the probability of default.
-  Easy-to-navigate user interface equipped with instructions and easy-to-comprehend results in the form of a visualised bar.

### 🧗🏽‍♂️ Real-Time Automated Trading Algorithm using C++ (Planning Stage)
- Work in Progress
