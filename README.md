# Welcome to my profile! 👋

![Hello Gif](https://media1.tenor.com/m/BbZnw0Mc1mUAAAAd/crow-smart.gif)

My name is Ubayd Knight. I'm an **Accounting & Economics final-year student at the University of Huddersfield**, attempting to make something big from my passion in data science, machine learning, and analysis. 

Therefore, what you see here is solely the result of a combination of utmost interest and uncapped passion of everything related to code and data. 

Here's a glimpse into my journey heading into the ultra-competitive industry of Data Science:

## 🚀 About Me

- ❗ **Innovator**: Before moving onto anything, I take pride in being a **massive innovator** and always learning about what could change the future. I'm planning on creating a useful application for **equity research, investment analysis, or portfolio management teams** with a small team. My ultimate goal is to exceed my own set boundaries/expectations and create as much value within the finance/data industries as much as possible.
- 📚 **University**: I am a **Student Ambassador**, studying a **BSc Degree in Accounting and Economics at the University of Huddersfield**. Currently I am planning on locating a graduate scheme with plans to continue towards a Masters degree within 5 years.
- 🎓 **Academic Achievements**: On track to achieving a target of a **high Second-Class Grade** with multiple first-class marks and a strong academic record on several Accounting & Economics modules.
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Data science techniques, Deep Learning, Advanced Python, TensorFlow, and Swift. Outside of Data, I'm also learning how to become a better sim racer as well as a competitive gamer (I recently reached Top 1500 Globally at a competitive first-person-shooter game).
- 👨‍💻 **Future Goals**: Becoming a **Data Scientist** at a renowned firm to contribute to and lead impactful projects in at any industry that involves finance, sustainability, or technology.
- 📖 **Interests and Hobbies**: Working with Data, Simulator Racing, Actively Engaging in Friendly Competitions, Hardware Engineering, Formula 1, Stock Trading, and Mechanical Keyboards.

## 💼 Projects

### 🔢Encoder-Decoder Generative Training Model (40%)
- Built mainly with Python, Torch, and Tensor under a JupyterLab environment.
- Tokenises text at the character level, creating a basic vocabulary.
- Encodes and decodes text using a custom mapping.
- Prepares data for model training with sequences and targets. (Needs refinement as of 21/01/2025)
- Implementing a basic neural network model for character prediction, showcasing the use of embeddings and cross-entropy loss for training.

### 📈 Quantitative Momentum Strategy (100%)
- Built using Python Machine Learning Libraries
- Provides a specialised S&P500 portfolio given realistic constraints containing stocks with the highest past momentum
- Made using PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook.

### 🧮 Opulens: Personal Financial Budgeting Website (70%)
- Built with **Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Tableau**
- Provides budgeting tools and interactive visualizations for users.
- Currently expanding to process **user-input information** and deliver personalised insights.
- Hosted on **AWS** with near-perfect front-end implementation (aborted due to costs for the time being).

### 📖 US Market Index Analysis with Google Trends (100%)
- Built using R Code
- Explores the relationship between various US Indices including the Volatility Index (VIX), with Google Trends data regarding both economical and financial search terms to test whether or not it'll be sufficient for forecasting.
- Utilises various machine learning and statistical models and theories to enhance, validate, and evaluate prediction accuracy.
  
### 🧗🏽‍♂️ Real-Time Automated Trading Algorithm using Alpaca API (Planning Stage)
- Look to either be using the latest NVIDIA Nano Super Orin (Linux) or just a standard Mac Mini M4
- May have to look into abandoning Alpaca APIs in general and switch to C/C++ for performance/latency purposes

  
## 💻 Skills

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Frameworks & Tools**: TensorFlow, Django, Tableau
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Services**: AWS
- **Data Visualizations**: Tableau, matplotlib, plotly, pandas
- **Others**: Eikon API
