## 💼 Projects

### 📈 Quantitative Momentum Strategy (100%)
- Built using Python Machine Learning Libraries
- Provides a specialised S&P500 portfolio given realistic constraints containing stocks with the highest past momentum
- Made using PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook.

### 🧮 Opulens: Personal Financial Budgeting Website (70%)
- Built with **Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Tableau**
- Provides budgeting tools and interactive visualizations for users.
- Currently expanding to process **user-input information** and deliver personalised insights.
- Hosted on **AWS** with near-perfect front-end implementation (aborted due to costs for the time being).

### 📖 US Market Index Analysis with Google Trends (100%)
- Built using R Code
- Explores the relationship between various US Indices including the Volatility Index (VIX), with Google Trends data regarding both economical and financial search terms to test whether or not it'll be sufficient for forecasting.
- Utilises various machine learning and statistical models and theories to enhance, validate, and evaluate prediction accuracy.
  
### 🧗🏽‍♂️ Real-Time Automated Trading Algorithm using Alpaca API (Planning Stage)
- Look to either be using the latest NVIDIA Nano Super Orin (Linux) or just a standard Mac Mini M4
- May have to look into abandoning Alpaca APIs in general and switch to C/C++ for performance/latency purposes

  
## 💻 Skills

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Frameworks & Tools**: TensorFlow, Django, Tableau
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Services**: AWS
- **Data Visualizations**: Tableau, matplotlib, plotly, pandas
- **Others**: Eikon API
